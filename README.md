## General Information
- This project was entirely built to practice bootstrap, although I have used it before I was able to take my time and look through the docs and focus on the fundamentals and fill in any gaps.
- Iâ€™m focusing on the MERN stack and learning bootstrap will allow me to build out projects faster so I can focus on React, MongoDB and Node ( Express ) when working on other applications or expanding on this one.
- I added a little Javascript to breath some life into the project and once I spend more time on Node I will look to add a server and stripe.

## Technologies Used
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Lessons Learned
- 12 column grid design
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive Utility Classes
- Being more aware of array methods wether they mutate ( e.g sort ) or not.
